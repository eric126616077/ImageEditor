# Image Editing Application

This is an image editing application that allows users to adjust image properties, rotate images, crop images, and save the edited images.

## Purpose and Target Market

The purpose of this software is to provide users with a user-friendly image editing application. It is designed for individuals, photographers, graphic designers, or anyone who needs to edit and enhance images.

## Software Development Process

The software development process applied for this project is Agile. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, have been chosen for their flexibility, adaptability, and ability to incorporate frequent customer feedback. The Agile approach allows for iterative development, continuous improvement, and collaboration among team members.

## Development Plan

- Implement advanced filters, text overlay, and batch processing for enhanced editing capabilities.
- Introduce image effects like blurring, vignetting, and lens distortion to enhance artistic appeal.
- Enable social media integration for easy sharing of edited images.
- Add undo/redo functionality and advanced editing tools for more precise edits.
- Explore collaboration features, cross-platform compatibility, and performance optimization.
- Gather user feedback and conduct market research to inform future enhancements.
- Prioritize bug fixes, quality assurance, continuous learning, and innovation.
- Engage with the community to foster a sense of ownership and involvement.
